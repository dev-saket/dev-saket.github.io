<p>My name is Saket Kumar.  </p>

<p>What else do you need? </p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
I grew up reading Shakespeare's and Wordsworth's, that makes me a firm believer in true love. I believe in simplicity and down-to-earthness. I prefer to do things that bring me inner peace like writing, learning new cultures, travelling, reading, watching movies and of course my job of software's.
</p>
<p>My intense addiction for movies make me surf through IMDB for hours. Please feel free to go through <a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44833622/lists">my favourite movies list</a> and get in touch to have movie related discussion at any time. </p>

<p>I also have <a href="https://saket-wantz-u.blogspot.com/">an old blog</a>, that contains my short stories from initial days. I want to have a reference to it somewhere.</p>
