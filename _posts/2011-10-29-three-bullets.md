The extent of love and lust is never known. The idea of losing someone you really love is enough to drive the hell out of you. If you can give your life for the sake of your love, you can even take somebody's life for your love's sake. I wish I could define all the types of love and their boundaries.

No offense to hot and sexy ladies but one thing is for sure, however hot and sexy we boys may want our girlfriends to be, we want our wives or persons with whom we want to spend our entire life to be absolute serene, simple, soft, smart, caring and of course beautiful. But when it comes to our GFs we know it already how long (or to be exact, short) our relationships are gonna last so the precise words to define them would be bold, hot and sexy, less caring, less obsessive, less possessive, dynamic, egoist, volatile and blah, blah, blah….. (Anything that would make you get rid of them easily)

**Scene - I**

So once it was 2:00 am in the chilling winter morning when we were having a group discussion (actually it was a group of just three friends me, Abhi and Nishit) on most killing topic "What would you do when you know the person whom you love most is cheating on you and you finally find him/her sleeping with some other person?".

“Come on man, its 2:00 am in the morning. Why not talk about some hot topics like ‘Girls of the city center’ or ‘How will you grade girls of our college on 10 point scale?’ Please don’t spoil our precious night by bringing on this boring topic.” Nishit said.

“You, wanker. The only thing you have known in your life is to put your right hand to perfect use. Ain’t this love shit defined in your dictionary? Have you ever had the idea of perfect women in your life? Imagine a person whom you have loved most in this world and despite your eternal love for her, only betrayal is reciprocated. What would you do then?” I said.

“This is the reason I don’t want to take a useless risk falling in love with someone. Frankly speaking whenever I see a beautiful girl, I feel something but I know it for sure this isn’t love. I also feel like doing something but never like loving her. Instead I like to put my hands to proper use.”

“Leave it, Nishit. I will talk to you and smash your ass the day you get close to some girl. I wish I can express this inner feelings of yours to every girl you try being nice to in future. Till then you have to take part in the discussion just by imagining yourself in this position. And Abhi, what do you think of this?”

“Literally I don’t think this is ever happening to me because I will love a person when I know her the best and when I will love her most, why will she ever go to someone else for less love? So no, this is not applicable to me too.”


“Come on guys I am not saying we already have got cheated. God forbid this ever happens to any of us except Nishit. I would be so glad when children of Nishit would look like some third person. Just kidding but the point is, imagine if you are in such situation, what will you do?” I said.

“I don’t know. I will be highly disappointed, frustrated, hopeless and furious too. My whole world would come to end. I would fire the whole world in my rage.” Abhi said.

“I totally agree” Nishit said without even giving a thought to it.

“Shut up you moron. As if you know anything he is talking about. And Abhi, firing the world won’t let aside this fact that your another half who used to love you a lot once is with someone else” I said.

“So true”, said Nishit with a huge yawn.

“I can’t even bear the thought of it. Okay, you say what you will do when you find so?” said Abhi.

“My heart will be set on fire even when someone stares her. I will just kill that motherfucking bastard.” I said.

“But that again won’t change the fact. It’s your girl who cheated on you and not that guy. So this is not still the total solution.” Abhi said.

“Kill that bitch. This is the perfect solution. I say you these girls are the cause of all problems. Eve made Adam to eat the apple and the whole human race is suffering, Mahabharata took place because of Dropadi and Ramayana because of kidnapping of Sita. Avoid the love with women but never avoid womanizing and your life will be good like never before. You love them with all your might and what you get in return is a betrayal. So better remove the root cause by killing that bitch.” Nishit said trying to prove that he was listening the entire time. I wondered if any of his words was relevant to our discussion.

“Shut up you, fuckface. Do you know what the word for male-slut is? You are worse than that. Our topic of discussion is ‘What would you do when you know the person whom you love most is cheating on you’ and not ‘What women have done to this world?’ The cheating person may be a man too. And you cannot even dream to harm the person whom you love the most. So why don’t you open your half shut eyes and give us some valid points.” I said.

“You only said I have to take part in this discussion. That’s what I am doing and besides my points are extraordinary. Love is the worst vampire I have ever known. It will suck out all your blood and leave you bleeding on the floor. Come on Abhi, back me up.”

“Ha ha ha ha.. You know what, the word love sounds quite ugly from your mouth. Love is like a Tsunami dear, you never know when it is coming and even if you are fortunate enough to know it, you can do nothing to stop it. I swear, one day you will learn to respect women and love both. And regarding this topic, if this ever happens to me I won’t have strength to bear all these. I will kill myself and finish all the pain. End of the discussion. Let us go to sleep, it’s already 4:00 am in the morning.” Abhi said.

This was our first discussion out of which no conclusion came. It was already too late, so we left for our homes. I wasn’t feeling good about it. There must have been some way out. I was moving to my home thinking really hard on this topic.

**Scene – II**

I reached my home quite tensed. I was much tired but the topic we were discussing about wouldn’t let me sleep. Hardly had I closed my eyes when my wife came.

“What happened honey, anything wrong? Why is cute smile missing from your lips? I was missing you so much. I love you a lot but you don’t care about me. Your late night hanging out with friends even once a week makes me impatient. I was waiting for you.” God, she was beautifully beautiful. I used to see her everyday and each day she became more beautiful. Lucky man I was to have such a wife who loved me the most. Thanks God, I was never going to be a part of topic we were discussing. All my pain and worries vanished in the moment I saw her.

“Nothing sweetheart, we just had a hard discussion in our talk of the town. Never mind. I am the luckiest man alive to have you. You make my days and nights beautiful.” A tight hug and a soft kiss put me in six hours hibernation.

Next day I woke up and went to work but that topic was still not out of my mind. I was feeling different. I felt as if the most important puzzle of my life remained unsolved. There sure needed to be an absolute solution to that. I knew I was being a total pessimist but I couldn’t help myself out.  

The bright side of my heart said, “Come on, dude. You have got a beautiful wife who loves you a lot. The whole world may end but you will never get cheated in your love.”  

While the dark side strongly opposed,” Nothing is eternal in this world. What if her love fades away one day? What if she starts liking someone else? What if she is already seeing someone else and you don’t know about it? What if you come to know about it when it is too late? Have you ever given a thought? If not better start thinking about it.”  

I was too deep in dilemma. The bright side and dark side of my heart were fighting badly. Even though I shouldn’t but I started giving some thought to it. And then began the destruction of my life. All the bad things started happening one by one and I couldn’t avoid any of them.

I started behaving differently from that day. I could feel I was becoming a total stranger. But that wasn’t the worse part; the worst part was my wife, who claimed to love me the most, never noticed it. So I started getting more distracted. The one who could feel my pain before I spoke never came to know that her soul mate was internally at war. Even though there was nothing wrong, I started to smell something fishy. I began to suspect her and decided to keep an eye.  

My night shifts were on at work. Though I never called her from work at night because she wouldn’t be able to sleep, I decided to call that day. But there were no end to surprises then. I kept on calling her for an hour but she never responded. Her earlier voice, “Your late night hanging out with friends even once a week makes me impatient. I was waiting for you” kept ringing in my head. I didn’t dare to find it out soon but she didn’t respond to my calls at night for next two weeks.

My night shifts were over and I was at work one afternoon when I got a severe headache. I didn’t feel like working plus strange things at home had terribly troubled me. I took a day off and returned home but to my surprise the doors were locked from outside. I opened them with my own set of keys. I lay down on bed for an hour taking rest but she wasn’t still back. I decided to call her. I kept calling her for next one hour but her phone was out of coverage. My headache was still not over, so I thought applying balm might help a little. While searching for it in drawers, I came across my 9mm pistol. I was so filled with despair that I picked it up. I didn’t know what to do with it but kept holding it in my hand and fell asleep. I woke up two hours later. It was 5:00 pm in the evening. My headache was gone, the gun was still in my hand and she wasn’t yet back. I looked at my gun and I had a strange feeling that very soon this would be brought to use. However, I kept it back into drawer then.

I called her again but her number was busy. I freshened up and settled down to read my favorite novel. Few minutes later I heard a familiar voice talking at a distance. Then the main door opened. It was my wife talking to someone on the phone. She was so busy talking that she didn’t even noticed the main door not locked.

“Okay honey, I am home. Will see you tomorrow, till then don’t forget me. Bye.” She was talking on the phone. She entered the room and was bewildered seeing me home already.

“Oh, dear. How come you are home this soon? I was missing you a lot. I was feeling kind of homesick, so I decided to move out. You should have called me, I would have come earlier.”

“I kept calling you for an hour. Your phone was out of coverage area. And whom were you talking on phone now.” I asked seriously and stood up.

“I was talking to my cousin, Ankita. She found a new boyfriend. She didn’t stop blabbering about him even for a second. Anyway, when did you come and how was your day?” She said casually looking into my eyes and hugged me. Girls are the only creature on this earth that can lie to you looking directly into your eyes.

“I just came five minutes ago and my day was fine. I am kind of super busy doing my work.” I lied too.

“That’s good for you.” She said and hugged me more tightly. When she hugged me this time, I smelt a different perfume on her body. It was not her’s, she always used L'Oréal. It was a men’s perfume and definitely it wasn’t mine.

“What is this perfume you used today? Trying brands other than L'Oréal? “

“Oh, honey. This is a men’s perfume. I tried it at mall thinking you may like it. Doesn’t it smell good? You should start using this one.”

Her explanations didn’t go along with her gestures. I felt choked from inside. I couldn’t sleep that night and then many more nights. After few days I had to go out of city for business. It was to take a week’s time. I reached airport early but to my disappointment the flight was delayed for two hours. I took a lonely seat to wait and all I could think was about her. All our happier moments were revolving around my head. How I used to love her a lot and how she loved me back. I still loved her more but a lot of things had changed. She wasn’t the person I loved. I was feeling suffocated when there was announcement that my flight was delayed for another four hours. Each second was passing like eternity. I finally decided I was not going anywhere. “Fuck the whole goddamn business. My life is getting ruined, what I will do of this job. My whole world is she.” I thought. I decided to go back home and talk to her directly. I wanted to solve everything; I wanted to make her mine again. I rushed home even without giving a single thought.

I reached home within an hour. The main door was unusually not locked from inside. I opened the door and got in. The second unusual thing was I heard a chattering noise coming out of my bedroom. I went towards my bedroom. The door was slightly open. I peeped to see what was going on inside. I had a nervous breakdown after what I saw. A mixed feeling of anger, despair, frustration and pain was flowing through my blood. I felt strangled. I saw my wife in arms of other man. My whole world had come to an end. I remained lifeless for next few minutes without feeling a thing. And then when I got my senses back, I thought this is not the way it was supposed to end. I rushed to my study room and took my 9mm pistol out of drawer. I hid it behind my back and kicked the door of my bedroom open. 

Both of them were dazzled and became red faced. She couldn’t speak a word but he came forward and said,”we don’t want a fight here. Do we?”

“Of course not, motherfucker.” I said taking out my pistol and shot him straight in the head. She became a wounded lioness or literally a bitch after seeing this. She started shouting loudly. The whole floor was covered with his blood. I didn’t pay attention to anything she was shouting until she said, “Don’t you see, bastard. I loved him.”

“I loved you more than anything, you fucking street bitch.” I cried pointing my gun at her then. My hands were shaking terribly. I continued, “And you loved me too before. What happened to your love now? Sold it in a market to some hungry wolf? I still love you a lot but you don’t deserve to live on this earth. Sluts only deserve the hell and I will send you there right now.”

My hands stopped shaking and she got what she deserved with the shot of second bullet. I didn’t regret a little while shooting her but the moment she was dead, I realized what I had done. I had finished my world with my own hand. “How did I even dare to harm her? I loved her truly. What will I do by living this life?” I thought and pointed the gun at myself now.

My hands were not shaking then and I didn’t hesitate to pull the trigger when I felt a terrible pain in my ass. Before I could understand my head and ass connection, I realized I had slept for 20 hours straight and that was all a dream. Abhi and Nishit were kicking my ass to get me up.

Thanks God, I was still the luckiest man alive. I heard Abhi and Nishit shouting, 

“Don’t you have anything else to do in this world other than sleeping? Get up and let’s go for a ride.”

“Wait. I found the perfect solution to our last night discussion.”

“And what can the perfect solution be?” asked Abhi.

“3 Bullets” I said and told them about my dream……
